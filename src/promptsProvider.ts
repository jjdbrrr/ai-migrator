                                - Add the delimiter "${FILE_CONTENTS_KEYWORD}" at the very beginning of the response and output file content without wrapping it as code.
                                - At the end of the file content, add the delimiter "${KEYS_KEYWORD}" followed by a JSON structure with the key names, descriptions, and translations.
                                - **Do not process any content that is already wrapped with T component or t functions.
                                - **Use T component only for suitable places. When the target needs string for some reason, use t function and add useTranslate hook to the component top.
                                
                                - **Only replace tests to translate**. Focus on replacing text in elements such as:
                                    - <div>Some Text</div>
                                    - <button>Some Text</button>
                                    - and other strings which will be rendered to the UI (anywhere)
                                    - including document titles, placeholder attributes, alt texts, aria-labels, etc.
                                - **For attributes or non-component contexts** (like placeholder or window title), use t function :
                                    - <input placeholder="New list item" /> should become <input placeholder={t('new-list-item')}) />
                                - Neever keep default in the code (it's stored to the json files')   
                                - **When generating key names**, ensure that each keyName is unique and descriptive, based on the original content. The key name should reflect the purpose or content of the string. **Do not use generic key names like "translations" in JSON files.**. 
                                    - For example, "Share" should map to "share-button", "App title" should map to "app-title", and "Add item" should map to "add-item".
                                - Do not modify or translate string literals inside any console functions (like console.log, console.error, console.warn). These should remain untouched.
                                - Generate a JSON structure that includes:
                                        - "name" (with underscores instead of dashes).
                                        - "description" (based on the text's context).
                                        - "translations" (with "en" containing the original text).
